Focusing on one thing is something I've been fighting for a long while. Maybe I have mild ADHD, But it doesn't matter, I will have ot get better at focusing on stuff. The problem is basically that I have so many things going on in my head at any given time that, it is hard to think of just one thing. Making it harder and harder to focus on the work/meeting I'm handling in the moment. This is not only not optimal in the longterm, I would be actively damaging everything.

A lot of times, this is because I __lack intent__ to when I do stuff. This results in me wandering aimlessly and this becoming a problem unto itself. Before doing a task, I should record it's intent in it.

notes:
- Talk with vishnu
  - Appu, reading for 5 minutes and taking breaks to text vs him finishing chapter after chapter


<s> ### Experiment1 - Time based "focus" segments

I generally don't believe timing, focus is a bad way of doing it because. The belief is that, when you are in "focus", you forget time and get all into it. But, this happens very rarely and hard to replicate.

At least in the short term, I strongly believe that I can gain a lot by segmenting my time.

#### Method
- Setup counter for a maximum of 2 hrs.
- Phone should be kept in silent mode or left in a place where there is little to no access
- Breaks aren't (usually allowed). Unavoidable scenarios are fine. More than 3 breaks in a session would count as a faulty session.

### Why focus?

operating on two different things, usually takes 3 times the time it would take. This is majorly due to the context switch overhead. Focusing on one thing at a time, is very much required to make sure I dig deep into the problem

### Frequent distractions:

These are my frequent distractions these days.
