It is now possible to create content that is, a few order of magnitude more than the total time available to all humans currently alive. and I'm confident a major percentage of them can be tailored to be interesting for a person with specific psyche. My opinion is that human attention is going to become more and more valuable, yet it is going to get very difficult to focus on something for extended periods of time. What does this mean for the media ecosystem.

## for Creators.

This is a typical pattern in technology. Something is only accessible to the utmost power users and through the magic of market economics, it becomes more and more accessible to everyone. Cameras are a good example. the first image was taken in 1826

in ~200 years. we're taking 1.2 trillion images a year. even my 5 year old nephew knows how to work a camera.

With these AI generated media it is the same. There are extremely talented people using these tools to create very cool content with sophisticated orchestrators now. 

AI videos have already moved on from slop to addictive. it is only a matter of years before the model providers adjust the edges and ground the models well. AI content is being pushed from two ends. High end production houses are using AI in the edges and it is becoming easier and easier to create longer and consistent AI videos. No longer do you need the capex of buying good quality equipments for really attractive content. You just need some of that sweet sweet GPU time and you can find the video that will satisfy your consumers, within the hyperspace.

## for Consumers.

We're already seeing an explosion of content from everywhere. Consumers are in a perpetual war for attention. AI tools have already amplified this, [AI ASMR cutting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEWX_fHMOEg),  [AI cat videos](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/aug/18/ai-has-created-a-new-breed-of-cat-video-addictive-disturbing-and-nauseatingly-quick-soap-operas) etc.

## for you.

All that is really cool for longer term. What does this mean for the individual? how are you supposed to navigate this?

As with the internet and social media before it. It is incredibly important keep your headspace free of slop. The demand for long, intense focus has never been higher. Being able to do focused work in a world where everyone is distracted. Maintain the sanctity of your headspace. Provide the nourishment it needs to grow and nothing more.


If you are a creator. You should be trying out all the new tools. there is still moat in having a deeper understanding of the model and how it works and being able to traverse the hyperparameters easily. Lean into that.
