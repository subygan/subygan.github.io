Inertia is the best way to keep oneself active and consistent.
Any sort of plan, trumps having intense velocity at the task.

The good thing with velocity is that it reduces your focus and brings you to the task at hand. There are always infinite things to ponder, infinite status games to play. But the work at hand is more important than all of them. And Velocity is the only way to focus and pour all energy into a singular thing. 


No great thing has ever been accomplished by doing mundane things. Importance of the task matters.
I like this anecdote from Feynman, when he joined a lab to work on computers they asked him to give a lecture to the employees because the company did not know what to do with such a high potential individual. Hearing this, he said that he doesn't want to do a made-up job and asked if there was any real job. so the company head sent him to buy some pens for the team and Feynman happily did this.

That is the type of focus that breeds when one focus on current state versus focusing on fake ego gratifying rewards.
