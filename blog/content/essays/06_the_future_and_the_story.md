Companies are valued much higher when they are pursuing something super big, super into the future. eg, facebook => meta, amazon => cloud, etc

This is useful for companies to pump their valuation. see https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30916357

this works because the future is unpredictable and un plannable. Which means that the only way we make sense of the future is through stories.
