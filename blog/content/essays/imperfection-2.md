As I reflect further on my [imperfection ideology](/essays/imperfection). It seems obvious that, the amorphous nature of the content is bound to be misinterpreted. It could be seen as an escape clause to be lazy and non-agile physically or otherwise. saying that they’re being “real” or that they’re being content with themselves and don’t give a  about what others think.


The core principle of the  ideology is not uncontrolled lethargy. But, a superior control over the sanity. Which is paradoxical because, the same thing can be used to represent two polar ideas.


I’ll elucidate my point with a hypothesis. Imagine a second grader, who’s struggling to memorize his alphabets. It would look pointless and useless to him. Let’s addle his brains with our ideas of being proud of his imperfections and being “real”. It might seem an obvious conclusion for him to make that, he’s okay with being imperfect by not knowing the alphabets and doesn’t care about how the earth spins. He has no need to do the gruesome alphabets for no teacher and could just be content with himself being ignorant and illiterate.


See the problem with the imperfection idea?


The acceptance of ignorance and inability is a clause to be adopted to have an amount of self worth and self sufficiency.


The idea is not a full stop to chasing dreams and  aspiring bigger better things. It is a way of picking yourself up and going at it again. It is, expecting to fail in something and still go all out on it. It is, accepting you’re the best that you can ever be and continue to be more better than you ever was. It is not about giving up. It is never about giving up.
