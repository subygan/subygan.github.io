## [Parkinson's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law)

> "work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion"

When Northcote made this observation, this was designed for organisations, but I believe this is a good representation for personal tasks as well.

If you commit to doing something in 1 hour it'll take 1 hour. If you commit 10 it definitely will take 10.
Which is what I end up doing, when I don't do things with

The world is probabilistic and opportunities for greatness are hidden in the crevice between, getting things done and saying yes.

Take on more responsibility. Accept invitations to be a part of someone's progress. This increases your surface are for serendipity and definitely widens ones horizon. It's surprising how wide the world is, if only we take the time to look outside our heads.

Saying yes, comes with the commitment to deliver on your promises. Which is harder the saying yes. and keeping it requires you to act with precision and results.


## Velocity breeds focus.

My wife says that we have to aspire to do everything within our reach. Which I think is quite inspirational, because it means you draw, but also work really hard and also take time for yourself. I never quite really reach that level of task effectivenes, although I try.


All people in my life who have a wide array of interests have this intensity and speed of doing things.


A friend of mine talks about maintaining a certain momentum, because on days when you're down the momentum you set for yourself will really keep you moving forward. Stagnation has this way of bogging you down into oblivion.


Sheer velocity improves efficiency. And yes, this might not be for everyone and it might be overwhelming at times. But I'm always happier that I got to push myself and do more than what I can today.

This embodies very clearly what I believe I should do.
