  Let me go there so there is a chance I can do important things.
- if you have the door to your office closed, you get more work done today and tomorrow, and you are more productive
  than most. But 10 years later somehow you don't know quite know what problems are worth working on;
- The people who do great work with less ability but who are committed to it, get more done that those who have great
  skill and dabble in it, who work during the day and go home and do other things and come back and work the next day.
- if you adopt the present method and do what you can do single-handedly, you can go just that far and no farther than
  you can do single-handedly. If you will learn to work with the system, you can go as far as the system will support
  you.'
- After all, if you want a decision `No', you just go to your boss and get a `No' easy. If you want to do something,
  don't ask, do it. Present him with an accomplished fact. Don't give him a chance to tell you `No'. But if you want a `
  No', it's easy to get a `No'.

- [Art and science of spending money](https://collabfund.com/blog/the-art-and-science-of-spending-money)
    - 1.Your family background and past-experiences heavily influences your spending preferences.
    - 2.Entrapped by spending: Rather than using money to build a life, your life is built around money.
    - 3.Frugality inertia: a lifetime of good savings habits can’t be transitioned to a spending phase.
    - 4.An emotional attachment to large purchases, particularly a house.
    - 5.The joy of spending can diminish as income rises because there’s less struggle, sacrifice, and sweat represented
      in purchases.
    - 6.Asking $3 questions when $30,000 questions are all that matter
    - 7.Social aspiration spending: Trickle-down consumption patterns from one socioeconomic group to the next.
    - 8.An underappreciation of the long-term cost of purchases, with too much emphasis on the initial price.
    - 9.No one is impressed with your possessions as much as you are.
    - 10.Not knowing what kind of spending will make you happy because you haven’t tried enough new and strange forms of
      spending.
    - 11.The social signaling aspect of money, on both things you buy for yourself and charity given to others.
    - 12.The social hierarchy of spending, positioning you against your peers.
    - 13.Spending can be a representation of how hard you’ve worked and how much stress went into earning your paycheck.
    - “If you only wished to be happy, this could be easily accomplished; but we wish to be happier than other people,
      and this is always difficult, for we believe others to be happier than they are.”

    - MONEY IS A SOCIAL FACT, EVEN WHEN THE MONEY IS BITCOIN OR ETHER
    - Finance, at its heart, is about moving future wealth into the present by borrowing, or moving present wealth into
      the future by saving.
    - The mechanism would be a smart contract that holds A tokens of type T1, and B tokens of type T2, and maintains the
      invariant that A * B = k for some constant k (in the version where people can invest, k can change, but only
      during investment/withdrawal transactions, NOT trades). Anyone can buy or sell by selecting a new point on the
      xy=k curve, and supplying the missing A tokens and in exchange receiving the extra B tokens (or vice versa). The
      “marginal price” is simply the implicit derivative of the curve xy=k, or y/x.

    - An interesting keyhole view into how the international monetary transactions works. I'm pretty much convinced that
      blockchain could solve this problem. The way right now is that there are a lot of hops between exchanges at the
      national level and international level with a lot of implicit trust, to move money around. I think blockchain
      could replace the chain of trust with a simple API.
    - But then, the fluctuating/increasing transaction fee + reducing mined amount is pretty worrysome. If not BTC I
      think something from the blockchain playbook has the potential to change it.

      the argument goes that, Something that might not be valuable right now, might turn out to be something of pretty
      intense value in hindsight. For example, rearing children, taking care of older parents, cleaning ones house all
      of these have clear economic value, But not counted as value in most places. Similarly, what other things aren’t

- [Avoiding internet centralisation](https://mnot.github.io/avoiding-internet-centralization/draft-nottingham-avoiding-internet-centralization.html)
    - Types of cenralization
        - __Direct centralisation__ - eg. chat, messaging and videoconferencing protocol use this method
        - __Neessary centralisation__ - eg. DNS, Certificate Authority (CA) due to technical
          limitations.
        - __Indirect Centralization__ - In theory all nodes in the Internet are equivalent. But realistically some nodes
          drive much of the traffic of the internet
        - __Inherited Centralization__ - The network between two endpoints is a few stack below the OSI model. But
          whoever controls the network basically has control over the internet as well
        - __Platform Centralisation__ - While the protocol itself doesn't maintain centralization. It enables
          centralised service providers to have more control Over others. eg HTTP
    - __Limits of Decentralisation__ - there is no completely decentralised system. Although there has been some attempt
      at it. Centralisation starts evolving
        - __Federation is not enough__ - SMTP was evolved as a method to have a decentralised way to receive message
          even when the underlying Network, IP or the server changes. One way it is done is, The DNS handles the finding
          the user part and the Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) can be used to route message to anyone. But
          this has created a situation where there are Indirectly centralised systems like Gmail. Who have much better
          network effects and are able to elbow other small players away.
        - __Multi-Stakeholder Administration is hard__ - This is a model of centralisation where Multiple
          representatives from various stakeholders come together to decide on something. For example ICANN, CA, Browser
          Forum. These are a type of centralization but in some ways they are less centralised, as well
        - __Blockchains are not magical__ - Blockchains try to reduce centralization risk by distributing intermediary
          or otherwise potentially centralized functions to members of a large pool of protocol participants. The
          assignment of a task usually cannot be controlled (to avoid sybill attacks). These prevent _
          direct centralization, inherited centralisation_. There are a few issues with this though
            - __Distributed consensus protocols can have significant implications for privacy.__ Because all activities
              are shared with many unknown parties. Private Information Retrieval is incredibly (PIR)
              is incredibly easy
            - A lot communication back and forth + proof-of-work makes the whole network inefficient,
            - Distributed consensus protocol are still __not proven to scale__.
            - Responsibilities are diffused to certain unknown parties in the network. Making, control and management
              very difficult.
        - It is also possible that centralisation risk can happen elsewhere, eg, bitcoin trading places
