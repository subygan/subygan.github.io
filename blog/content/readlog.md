    - Computers, on the race to pack as much transistors as possible have evolved into a completely distributed system,
      with multiple modules talking to each other, with everything having different layers of abstraction, caching and
      implementation in between where each jump has it's cost. So everything has to be designed with that it minds.

    - An interesting keyhole view into how the international monetary transactions works. I'm pretty much convinced that
      blockchain could solve this problem. The way right now is that there are a lot of hops between exchanges at the
      national level and international level with a lot of implicit trust, to move money around. I think blockchain
      could replace the chain of trust with a simple API.
    - But then, the fluctuating/increasing transaction fee + reducing mined amount is pretty worrysome. If not BTC I
      think something from the blockchain playbook has the potential to change it.

    - There is no proper science. I used to think that we had incredibly cognitive scientists who are on the races to
      produce incredible results. But turns out, replication crisis is everywhere, and most papers were corrupted or
      faulty. Math, feels like the last frontier where these things could hold for a while.

    - “After world war II companies stopped advertising products for what they were to what they represent.” is an
      interesting thought. what else are the things that are like this??
    - Also, it is interesting that, Adam Smith would think that, arts such as music, drama, opera singers and actors
      didn’t create any value. While, in 21st century “attention economy” is a big part of the process. So, basically
      the argument goes that, Something that might not be valuable right now, might turn out to be something of pretty
      intense value in hindsight. For example, rearing children, taking care of older parents, cleaning ones house all
      of these have clear economic value, But not counted as value in most places. Similarly, what other things aren’t
      we counting towards economic value right now, but over time might turn out to be valuable, are NFTs something like
      that??

      and protocols need to be free and open for mass adoption. and without that the protocols.

- [Avoiding internet centralisation](https://mnot.github.io/avoiding-internet-centralization/draft-nottingham-avoiding-internet-centralization.html){:target="_blank"}
    - Types of cenralization
        - __Direct centralisation__ - eg. chat, messaging and videoconferencing protocol use this method
        - __Neessary centralisation__ - eg. DNS, Certificate Authority (CA){:target="_blank"} due to technical
          limitations.
        - __Indirect Centralization__ - In theory all nodes in the Internet are equivalent. But realistically some nodes
          drive much of the traffic of the internet
        - __Inherited Centralization__ - The network between two endpoints is a few stack below the OSI model. But
          whoever controls the network basically has control over the internet as well
        - __Platform Centralisation__ - While the protocol itself doesn't maintain centralization. It enables
          centralised service providers to have more control Over others. eg HTTP
    - __Limits of Decentralisation__ - there is no completely decentralised system. Although there has been some attempt
      at it. Centralisation starts evolving
        - __Federation is not enough__ - SMTP was evolved as a method to have a decentralised way to receive message
          even when the underlying Network, IP or the server changes. One way it is done is, The DNS handles the finding
          the user part and the Mail Transfer Agent (MTA){:target="_blank"} can be used to route message to anyone. But
          this has created a situation where there are Indirectly centralised systems like Gmail. Who have much better
          network effects and are able to elbow other small players away.
        - __Multi-Stakeholder Administration is hard__ - This is a model of centralisation where Multiple
          representatives from various stakeholders come together to decide on something. For example ICANN, CA, Browser
          Forum. These are a type of centralization but in some ways they are less centralised, as well
        - __Blockchains are not magical__ - Blockchains try to reduce centralization risk by distributing intermediary
          or otherwise potentially centralized functions to members of a large pool of protocol participants. The
          assignment of a task usually cannot be controlled (to avoid sybill attacks){:target="_blank"}. These prevent _
          direct centralization, inherited centralisation_. There are a few issues with this though
            - __Distributed consensus protocols can have significant implications for privacy.__ Because all activities
              are shared with many unknown parties. Private Information Retrieval is incredibly (PIR){:target="_blank"}
              is incredibly easy
            - A lot communication back and forth + proof-of-work makes the whole network inefficient,
            - Distributed consensus protocol are still __not proven to scale__.
            - Responsibilities are diffused to certain unknown parties in the network. Making, control and management
              very difficult.
        - It is also possible that centralisation risk can happen elsewhere, eg, bitcoin trading places

    - Bottomline: Somebody's using the blockchain as a resiliency platform to host botnet. So, when some authority
      removes the botnet. the botnet never goes away because it lives in the blockchain. Interesting and a more
