cold emailing is very powerful, but doing it effectively is a very difficult task. There are so many things to consider, before sending out an email. This is a collection of successful cold emails I've found around the web.

This is meant to be a repository of successful cold emails that converted and created impact.

These only cover cold emailing as an individual to a decision maker about something you want to get done. Not any other use cases.
