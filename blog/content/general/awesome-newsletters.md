### [Pg's Essays](https://paulgraham.com/articles.html)

- Incredibly interesting if you are into the startup world and are generally curious about how the world operates.

- I started with [The Gervais Principle, or The Office According to "The Office"](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2009/10/07/the-gervais-principle-or-the-office-according-to-the-office/). Set aside a couple of hours before you start reading this. because it is really long and incredibly engrossing.

### [Sriram Krishnan](https://sriramk.com/)
