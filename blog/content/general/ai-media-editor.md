The first animation movie, toy story was made in 1995. At that time this was a break through. It involved a lot of proprietary software (Ray tracing, shaders, motion blur) and decades of research and development.
In 2025, for the first time a movie made in open source software (blender) received the oscar.

I believe by 2030 the first end to end AI animated movie will win the Oscar. This is not because AI is able to make jokes better, or because it is able to iterate through huge dialogues and text better. But because along with a human, AI accelarates imagination. As Steve Jobs puts it, [computer was the bicycle for the mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmuP8gsgWb8). If so, then AI is the ferrari for the mind. Agreed, most jobs probably don't need a ferrari for the mind. There is even the question of whether AI is a ferrari? regardless, it has been proven time and time again that an Individual and an AI beat both AI alone or Human alone.

It won't matter who has access to the most production money. it won't matter who has the best connection. What would matter is who ,has the taste, is able to sweat the details and deliver their vision. AI can effectively make Content production accessible. Much like, how the iphone, or protools enabled the next generation of artists.

Instead of writing a story from head to toe, you would end up molding the story with the AI. You find the exact music that would emulate the tone of your story, You find different angles to the same scene. The level of levarage that this provides to people is incredible.

While there are a lot of marketforces at play. This will end up happening. And I want to enable people to tell their stories. I want to build the future of media.
