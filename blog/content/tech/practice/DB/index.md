## Relational model

__Relation__ is unordered set of __tuples__. A __tuple__ is a set of attribute values.

### Primary Keys

Synthetic Ids created to identify a tuple. Some dbs autogenerate these keys.

### Foreign Keys:
 
Defines mapping between two tables.

### Data manipulation Language (DML)

- Procedural
  - The query specifies the strategy to fetch the data.
- Non-Procedural
  - The query only specifies only what data is wanted and not how to find it.
