I have this habit of memorising new words, each time I hear one and I remember the perfect scenario of the words because it helps in remembering them. So generally my head is filled with stupid instances when I heard or read them. 


For example, Robert Downey Jr. says “It’s so overt that it’s covert.” in Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows when going out for Watson’s bachelor party. and Sherman in Mr Peabody and Sherman says, “It’s an apocryphal.” when mentioning the story of George Washington’s apparent felling of a tree. and I knew the meaning of audible in 9th standard maths class when the kid behind me said it to my teacher.


and a  lot more of this kind.


Sometimes I forget these instances and I’ll have to brood very long before it strikes me. Which caught me wondering wouldn’t it be cool to have a dictionary of you. Only the words you want to remember and how you remember them. Like you could actually type in the meaning of the word, based on your perception of it. and when you forget you could summon them.


So decided to make one.


I saved the words in a JSON file and accessed it through an AppJar GUI. Now, whenever I need to save a new word, I’ll just have to mark a new word I go edit in the JSON file.
