I always used to wonder how people create applications. Like, I’ll install an application and wonder how the production team would’ve discussed days on end to decide on the size of the buttons and their positions. It felt amazing, that people take so much care in these finicky details.


Now that I’m here and trying to make at least something out of code. I am now realising that this really is a pain in the ass work. The careful attention to detail, which I so marvelled in those apps and their designers is because of the nature of coding itself. Nothing about the beauty of their working.


As soon as I started I knew this was going to be real hard because I had no clue how to convert a button press into a function. Search after search lead me nowhere near it. Then I decided to ask my college IT professor because I had no other path visible. He was like, okay I’ll look into it. one, two, three days after waiting for my “apparent mentor” in corridors and cabins hoping he would help me (he didn’t). I decided, screw this and started all over again.


It took me a while to get here. But, I got here.
