Failing to read the documentation and understanding the code underneath is the bane of all software bugs and I've guilty of it on multiple counts

I'll record the times when I did not read the documentation/code enough and went chasing random bugs.

- Chasing my tail round and round when setting up containers in fly.io and ending up taking 5 hours for something that I could've done in 10 minutes if I read the documentation properly.
