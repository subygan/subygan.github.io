## Goals:

- Find a VPN solution that would be able to maintain an ACL.
- No licensing solutions


OpenVPN - Not Truly self-hosted, in the sense that you will have to pay for the software in the range of $7 per user. Even if you self host it

Wireguard - only transmission security, no endpoint security.
