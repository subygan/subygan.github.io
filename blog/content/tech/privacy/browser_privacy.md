I came across this website which tracks and tests privacy of various browsers. https://privacytests.org/
Takeaway IMO:

in desktop browsers

- Brave, Mullvad and librewolf seems better because of the built in ad protection. but brave clearly has better User experience.

- Tor + ublock origin seems to be the best case privacy protection, for the paranoid. Of course, tor usability is not very good.

- Safari is just as worse, or Worse than

in mobile browsers:
ios:
- Everybody is worse.
- This mostly because Apple's restriction on browser engine. Which is wrong

Android:
- Brave is better than others.
- Mullvad comes second.
