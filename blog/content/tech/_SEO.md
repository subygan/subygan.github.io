Without praying at the altar of google, A site doesn't exist in the internet.

A site can be registered by visiting [search.google.com](https://search.google.com/search-console)
But, before I'm handed over the tools for SEO google does a "ownership validation". they gave me a secret of sorts. I had to add a TXT Record in my DNS provider. And verify it.

then, I had to give the location to my 'sitemap.xml' to them. It takes upto a day.

_"Crawled currently not indexed"_ means that Google has crawled it, but has decided to not index it in results, either because the content was low quality or other reasons.
