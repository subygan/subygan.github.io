Theory seems more and more important, as I try to understand the underlying blocks. It's not enough to just know frameworks, I need to know the underlying assumptions and working of hte building blocks. These are all my experiments.

## What constitutes theory?

Anything that helps me __understand__ a system. Not necessarily just to operate on.
This can range from compilers to database to pretty much anything theoretical.
