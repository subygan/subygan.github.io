Python package management is a nightmare. Poetry somewhat solves it.


## new project 

```shell
poetry new <project_name>
```

## new shell
```shell
poetry shell
```

## setting up

pipx first

```shell(mac)
brew install pipx
```

```shell(linux)
apt install pipx
```

then,

```shell
pipx install poetry
```
