## Why switch from Intellij

Intellij was my most common IDE but I'm so tired of having to be a second citizen for every single plugin. Intellij needs to do a huge platform shift and become more open or be consumed by vscode. The amount of people who start with vscode is insane.


I predominantly use [VSCode Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/) because I like testing out arbitrary things and Coming fro intellij I'm used to a lot of crutches for my programming which I'm still not sure are there in VSCode yet.

I like that every config is a json file and everything can be configured back and forth.

It's still mind blowing to me how responsive the whole app is despite running on a browser. The typing latency feels slightly lower than intellij
