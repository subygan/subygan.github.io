## global gitignore

I'm surprised I only came to know on 2024 that you can have a global gitignore

you can just put this inside `~/.gitignore`


```
# Node
npm-debug.log

# Mac
.DS_Store

# Windows
Thumbs.db

# WebStorm
.idea/

# vi
*~

# General
log/
*.log
```


and then do,

```
git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore
```
 
good riddance .DS_Store

# LFS

## Installing Git-lfs

MacOS:

```bash
brew install git-lfs
```

Linux:

```bash
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/github/git-lfs/script.deb.sh | sudo bash

sudo apt-get install git-lfs
```

## Working with lfs

LFS manages blobs by just storing the hash pointer of the file int the CVS and treating it as a blob of binary this is kept track in the `.gitattributes` file.



When you clone a repo with lfs content.
do
```bash
git lfs pull
```
to get the actual content. Else it'll be a text file with a pointer to the actual file


To add a new file to Git LFS, you need to first track it with Git, then tell Git LFS to manage it. Here's how you do that:

```bash
git lfs install
git lfs track "<filename>"
git add .gitattributes # Adding the .gitattributes file to the repo
git add <filename>
git commit -m "Add <filename> to Git LFS"
```
