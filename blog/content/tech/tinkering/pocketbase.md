I've been looking for an alternative to firebase. Because OSS FTW!!

Pocketbase is an alternative with A bold claim.

But, it really does 2 things very well, AUTH APIs and CRUD APIs over DBs.

### Pros:
- Is a single binary
- Uses sqlite3, which means the database is integrated with the app itself
- Written in go, but does not require CGO to integrate with sqlite3

### Cons:
- Sqlite is only horizontally scalable.
- Feature set is limited.
