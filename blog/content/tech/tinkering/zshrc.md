## Setting up new zsh with oh my zsh

firs installing zsh involves

```shell
brew install zsh
```

While I don't really trust and run randomly downloaded shell files. This one is quite painless.

```shell
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

## Typical packages:

- `git` 
- `zsh-autosuggestions` 
- `poetry` 
- `zsh-syntax-highlighting` 
- `command-time` 
- `poetry`

```shell
plugins=(git zsh-autosuggestions poetry zsh-syntax-highlighting command-time poetry)
```
