- [Scalable Extraction of Traning Data from \(Production\) Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.17035.pdf)
  - Making LLMs repeat the same word over and over again makes them emit the training data 3.5X better
- [The pain of Building copilots](//)
  - Microsoft researchers document the pain of building an LLM based copilot for users and how developers find multiple things counter-intuitive
- [Microsoft LASER](https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/31/24057362/microsoft-llm-accuracy-laser-research-ai)
  - Microsoft uses LASER to intervene with a model and improve it's reasoning ability. sort of like a Laser eye research
- [Can Knowledge Graphs reduce Hallucinations?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.07914.pdf)
  - Creating a knowledge graph to ground the reasoning of the LLM helps in fixing the hallucination problem
- [Reasoning on Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01061.pdf)
  - Using a Graph to generate reasoning paths and utilize it to answer questions.
