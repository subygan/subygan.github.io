I'll add the ones with the most fun:utilization first

### Building Graphs using LLMs:

This strategy comes clearly under the __by LLMs__ category and the most obvious one as well. Because of their semantic understanding, LLMs can be prompted into providing the triplets of relationship between the entities in a piece of text. Throw a piece of text, and it draws a graph of the relationship between subjects and objects
This is a relatively straightforward utilization of an LLM's ability to find pattern in text.

### Pathfinding in a Graph

LLMs are not trained to traverse graphs. Especially, they've not been explicitly taught how to model a graph from a triplet. But seems like they perform fairly well. The first graph in the blog from [jacob brazeal]https://jacobbrazeal.wordpress.com/2022/09/23/gpt-3-can-find-paths-up-to-7-nodes-long-in-random-graphs/) is very telling.
