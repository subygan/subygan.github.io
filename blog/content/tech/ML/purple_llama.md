PurpleLlama is a new framework proposed by Meta to evaluate LLMs for their secure coding ability.
Meta advertises This as "Announcing Purple Llama: Towards open trust and safety in the new world of generative AI" in their [blog post](https://ai.meta.com/blog/purple-llama-open-trust-safety-generative-ai/)
But this naming is somewhat misleading as Purple LLama, the way it is implemented currently is that this checks the code output given by LLMs for security problems based on [MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration](https://cwe.mitre.org/). 
They have a better title in the paper, "Purple Llama CyberSecEval: A benchmark for evaluating the cybersecurity risks of large language models" because that is what it does currently

## CyberSecEval
This is the core part of the research paper which has created a [benchmark for LLMs](https://github.com/facebookresearch/PurpleLlama/tree/main/CybersecurityBenchmarks) to test generated code.
Implementors only have to implement a class to test 

Along with this Meta has also introduced a [CyberSafetyEval leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/facebook/CyberSecEval). This is good as it encourages companies to build models that provide secure code.

## [LLama Guard](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/llama-guard-llm-based-input-output-safeguard-for-human-ai-conversations/)

LLama Guard is a fine-tuned LLama with Anthropic's [human preference dataset](https://github.com/anthropics/hh-rlhf). Llamaguard performs better than OpenAI Mod in ToxicChat.
Other than that, in almost every other tests, LlamaGuard performs better in Meta's tests and OpenAI performs better in theirs because of Obvious reasons.

Except for adaptability. where the model is expected to adapt to a new policy change. In this case, LLamaGuard performs better than OpenAI in OpenAI's own OpenAi Mod benchmark.
Adaptability was tested purely with prompts, as this is a very flexible way of improving the policy
It is great that Meta is publishing these model completely available to everyone.
