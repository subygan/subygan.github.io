  - The book was good, but not great. 
  - the middle chapters from __simplistic Optimism__ were pretty interesting.

  - Blogs Make the News
    - Blog mediums such as, twitter, instagram, reddit and others and their operating mediums (users) have an outsized impact on the wider society, the way it thinks and operates.
    - Bigger news writers pick up signals from these mediums and decide to write articles about it.
  - Trading up the chain
    - Ryan exploits the above format, by first baiting smaller blogs who are hungry for anything. And then sending those to bigger authors in bigger publications. Until eventually it makes the SNL or some big shot recording
  - The blog con
    - Blogs are generally incentivized to increase their view count. this is True across youtube, instagram and others.
    - This makes them more open to create content that is able to sustain its virality thereby making a lot of impressions.
    - Veritasium's video "Clickbait is unreasonably effective". where he discusses his dilemma as a creator trying to educate people with great content vs creating content that would attract the user's attention immediately.
  - Tactic 1 - The art of the bribe.
    - Bloggers can be bribed into doing a lot of things.
    - Because they are already looking out for it and find no conflict of interest in it.
    - You can make famous actors tweet badly about themselves for as little as $35
  - Tactic 2 - Tell them what they want to hear
    - Bloggers actually __want__ to publish your story. Because they're usually just playing catchup with their peers.
    - Tell them what they want to hear and they'll publish it for you. It can be a scoop about a president or anything pretty much.
    - They're desperate and they will believe whatever you say
  - Tactic 3 - Give 'em what spreads
    - Do the heavy lifting for them. Find an angle in the story that would make it viral. Having a lot of pageviews is just a matter of being viral.
    - 
  - Tactic 4 - Help them trick their readers
    - less than 50% of readers stay more than 1 second in a page. and that is all it takes.
    - The news doesn't even have to be true, it could also be a speculation that something might be true.
    - Utilise the curiosity gap.
  - Tactic 5 - Sell them something they can sell
    - Give them something that they will be able to sell to their readers.
    - Every blogger is trying to sell something, a thought or an idea to their user. help them with it.
    - Imagine it like an infinite bazaar where readers are buyers who trade their time for content. Then, every blog owner is a shopkeeper who's trying to grab the most attention from the users. It is a fight to the bottom.
  - Tactic 6 - Make it all about the headline
    - There are many ways, the headline has to be funny, yet curiosity inducing. Should create shock between the people
    - Youtube thumbnail used to be from the 1/3, 2/3 and last part of a video. But now it can be anything. People can be tricked into watching a video without even the thumbnail having no relation to the content. eg. early days, youtube users tend to upload videos with thumbnails of women with small clothes.
  - Tactic 7 - Kill 'em with pageview kindness
    - If you could bring pageviews to an article, help the author out so that they're able to help you.
  - Tactic 8 - Use them technology against itself
    - Keep iterating over the headlines and the thumbnails
    - Use analytics to judge what ticks people off about an article.
    - It is known that the average reader only reads about 800 words of content
  - Tactic 9 - Just make stuff up
    - In today's fast economy we don't have to validate anything, we can just make random stuff up.
    - Services like HARO are there, where people are able to source just about anything.
    - There is a huge amount of confirmation bias going on with journalists
  - Irin carmon, The Daily show and Me
    - Blogs generally take words out of context and try to twist them out.
    - There are many scandals which were just something, that a blogger took out of context and twisted it around.
    - Irin Carmon, daily show and ryan all faced something similar
  - There are others
    - Ryan is not the only guy who's doing media manipulations.
    - There are definitely others who are definitely better than him.
  - Slacktivism is not activism
    - A lot of bloggers tend to raise awareness by being an activist.
    - But, Ryan has a different take on this that. These bloggers are just acting like they care, but all they want is the pageviews.
    - They prey on the goodwill of the user. 
  - Just passing this along
    - A lot of blogs usually summarize the content of a post by some bigger publication.
    - The blogs have to do this because they have to achieve post parity with their peers. By saying that this was from another publication, the responsibility of veracity is also delegated to the original blog.
    - This way, information travels from one end of the network to the other, while nobody takes responsibility for it.
    - This makes it easy for people like Ryan to manipulate
  - Cyberwarfare
    - A lot of governments are trying to influence each other through the same principles that Ryan is using.
  - The myth of corrections
    - Blogs, generally post a nasty article which gets crazy amount of views and then give an update in another article saying that the previous one was unfounded claims. The original blog stays up and receive 10X more views than the updates
    - This is called iterative journalism and d
  - The twenty-first-century degradation ceremony
    - Papers of old had a subscription based incentive. So, they had to maintain quality. But, with the pageviews incentive nobody has to maintain quality, but gain based on notoriety and quantity.
    - 
  - Welcome to unreality
    - Real life is mundane and boring.
    - But, people want something spicy in the news everyday.
    - Newspeople are just delivering that spiciness, day in and day out. Ethics and morality are out of the window in this system.
    - People are just taking mundane ideas and making them unreal and riling people up.
  - How to read a blog
    - Almost always what you're reading on a blog is inaccurate
    - If a blog references or summarizes another blog always read the original source.
    - Be on the lookout for weasel words like, "We hear that...", "Insider reports...", "Maybe...", "some speculate that....", "people are of the opinion that...." and other similar ones.
    - These are words that absolve the reporters from their responsibility and delegate it to an unknown third party.
  - The book was pretty good and for an outsider like me these are things that I've been speculating about, but couldn't put my finger on. This was a great read and would definitely suggest it to people
- Where wizards stay up late -  2023-03-15 14:28 âœ…
  - An incredible book, looking back at the birth of a technological marvel.
  - Any idea requires its own faithful followers. Packets in the internet are the building blocks of internet, but it took 4 - 5 years for people from the traditional phone industry to see the utility.
  - Things we assume as just regular reality today was just a spark in someone's mind years ago. This is true for the structure of a typical email to the laws and structures around us.
- The Psychology of Money - Katie Hafner and Matthew Lyon - 2023-03-28 14:28 âœ…
  - Great book on about money and other ideas, I definitely suggest it as a great read.
  - How we spend money is mostly dependent on our childhood and how we were raised. Children raised during the great depression are more thrifty than children who grow up during times of great increases in wealth. This feels obvious, until we realise that this applies to us as well. Growing from an environment of low resources makes us very efficient with them and vice versa.
  - Luck and Risk are tightly coupled together in most cases. We call the upside of risk as luck. So, when you luck out, it means there was a possiblity of a downside as well. We generally don't appreciate all the things we are lucky for. Like, how healthy we are or, how we have a loving family and the ability to protect them and the state of society in general. The story of the investment banker who shorted during the great depressions and then went on to lose all of his wealth is telling.
  - __Never Enough__ - The ability of a truly Rich person, is being able to say What I have is enough and exit the game. Mistaking a streak of luck for unbeatable skill and staking it all in Russian roulette is bound to make you broke. Knowing and having the freedom to quit is a super that is worth striving for. Stories of Madoff and Rajat Gupta.
  - __Compounding is leverage__ - Humans naturally don't understand compounding. We take it easy. Story of warren buffet with 13% compounding for 50 years vs the other guy investment banker with 30 % compounding for 20 years. It  is impossible to for the latter to catch up to the former in a lifetime. Short term setbacks don't matter, what matters is the ability to let compounding do its thing despite everything and trusting in the process. High frequency trading might be great for making a quick buck. But compounding is where the game actually is.
  - __Making wealth vs holding on to that wealth__ are two completely different skill sets and state of minds. The distinction is important to succeed in the long term. In general success in finance is not about making the one-off great pay up but, __it's all about consistently not screwing up__ and folding the cards when the game is not in our favour. Warren buffet has been only consistently not picking the failures. and that is what makes him a great investor. He can find stuff to not invest in.
  - By __having a bigger upside than downside__ we can make sure that we come out on top, irrespective of the outcomes. But, being consistent about how we make those decisions is hard.
  - Controlling our own future is the best way to feel free in our lives. There are researches showing that people who are able to call shots in their lives are the happiest. Dying people don't really care about the amount of money in their bank accounts, they only care about all the things they were able to do.
  - __Wealth is what we don't see__, We see a person in a ferrari and assume he's wealthy despite having no idea whether its rented or loaned or whatever. Usually wealth of a person is what you don't see, the cars they didn't buy the show-offs they didn't do. Living under your means and having your baselines satisfied is the most important thing in life.
  - __Saving consistently__ is one of the best predictor of financial success. it's like being on a diet for a healthier body. We might crave to buy that thing that we don't really need but the ability to say no and stick with our saving structure is very important.
  - __Being reasonable is more important than being rational__ because we are emotional beings and we need to take decisions based on multiple dimensions, in those cases being reasonable is more important than being coldly rational, especially when it comes to family.
  - History is only a map of what happened in the past not a map of what would happen in the future. Projecting something in the  past to the future is a fallacy that a lot of people make and something that is not reasonable. Surprising things happen constantly around us. But, the conundrum is that we are only able to predict something based on past incidents. 
  - Having and __error margin is very important__, because predictions carry risk with them and can turn tides quickly. In those case, having a healthy amount of margin of error is important.
  - The problem with consistent compounding is that we need to create a plan and then stick with it for years. But, we are humans and we change constantly, So will our goals, financial or otherwise. So, it is very important to take time to strategize better and have fallbacks.
  - When somebody is offering advice for free. be sure you understand their motivations properly. Usually, nothing comes for free and there are a lot of grifters trying to make a quick buck. For examples a company's stock price was supposed to represent it's value in the long term. But, some short term grifters aggregate onto a specific stock and push its value to high in the short term and creating a bubble.
  - Pessimism is easy because humans are generally risk averse and avoid ruin at all costs. Being optimistic takes a lot more creativity. Be the reason for a little bit more optimism in the world.
