I lived in Madurai till my first grade. So It's a really nostalgic town for me.
Madurai is a city with a rich 700 years of heritage, and is built around the Meenakshi temple and it's lore.

The temple was built 1190 CE, which really adds to the value. I walk from our home to the temple just to experience the nostalgia.

The food in Madurai is unrivalled in any city. The street food scene is also incredible, we get incredible coconut heart (tip of the coocnut tree), coconut embryo (insides of a sprouted coconut), Mutton/Beef soup and so much more for which I'm struggling to find translations.
