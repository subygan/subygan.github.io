Pittsburgh has the quaint old town vibe with its own special antiquated ecosystems. It definitely has the feeling of a once flourising industrial town, now in its midlife crisis trying to find it's place in the world.
I stayed in Pittsburgh from Aug 2023 - Dec 2024. Made really close friends here.

## Duquesne Incline

Duquesne Incline perfectly captures the pittsburgh spirit for me, really quaint, vast and exciting.
Definite visit if someone visits pittsburgh.


## Carnegie Museum

Carnegie Museum is located really close to CMU and I visit this place often to just take my mind of the stress of being a student in uncertain footings in uncertain times. Anyone who visits Pittsburgh should visit Carnegie Museum it's definitely worth it.

## CMU

CMU is an incredible place if you have a bit of pocket-money and want to explore something of your interest without worldly pressure.

Maybe for a Phd it's a little less stressfult. But Undergrad or Masters at CMU is really stressful because there is a lot of grind culture going on with the students. I've spent >36 continuous hours at the CMU campus and yet I wasn't the only person in the building. It would be really hard to outwork a CMU person.


There's very little else to do other than study if you're located anywhere near the campus as all the pubs are 30 minute walk away and down town is a 30 minute bus ride. Which doesn't sound as bad, but you're constantly surrounded by the college campus and stiff walking students from the college.

## Food Food Food

If I'm being honest with myself, food in Pittsburgh is really mid nothing stands out as shockingly good. Especially the Indian food, was below par for me.

Despite that there are some diamond in the rough restaurants that I like very much

__Revolution Noodle__ This was my favorite noodle place in CMU campus and I had it everyday and even crave it a little bit even now.


__Chaykhana__ - First time I had a Uzbek cuisine and fell madly in love with it. Incredibly good lamb in a long while. absolutely best mix of Stew, Rice, Dumpling. It's like the perfect intersection of Russia, India, and China. It is incredible.
