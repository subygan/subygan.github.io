Atlanta is what happens if you put too many white collars in the same space.
Downtown was very immaculate and the roads were slick, not to mention wide.

There are more pubs than Restaurants in Atlanta. I've never seen so many pubs in a city. Every other building was a pub. The rough ratio I fest was 8:1


## Beltline

The Beltline is a 22-mile loop that connects 45 neighborhoods.
It seems to have been a railway track that was converted into a walking trail.

I liked it a lot, it was very peaceful and serene. I walked around 5 miles on the beltline in the scorching heat.

The restaurant around the beltline were awesome. Within a mile you can pretty much find any cuisine you want. I had a great time eating around the beltline.


## Ponce City Market

This was a converted factory into a shopping mall. There were a lot of buildings and also very crowded. The rooftop bar was sweet.
Had some nice Pasta and Pizza here


## Piedmont Park

This was a huge park in the middle of the city. It's amazing to have such an accessible park in the middle of the city.
Downtown Atlanta felt like a dream city, with this park.

## Georgia Aquarium

By far my favorite place in Atlanta. I could easily spend a whole day at this place. Most of the exhibits were first time for me. Incredible that you get to go so close to the animals. Just a miracle. All the exhibits were immaculate. Not to mention the beluga whales, they're the most adorable things I've seen.

The best time to go is early in the morning at 9 am. It's not crowded and you can take your time to see the exhibits. Plus, you get to also see feeding of the animals.
My favorite moment was when the penguin keeper was hugging the penguins one by one. Damn, I wish I could do that.

## Food, Food, Food

__Aviva by Kameel__ - Best Mediterranean food. I had the best falafel in my life here + the chicken were to die for. And the price is mind-blowing. I had a full meal for $12. I went here twice, despite only being there for a week and having the urge to explore. I thought this was one of the best places to eat.

__Gunshow__ - This was a unique place. The food was good but the experience was better. The chefs come out with the food and you can choose what you want. All the food had a unique twist to it. Quite an experience.
