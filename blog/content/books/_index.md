  - But, That is only because the book is aimed at high level management ideas

- __lost Focus__ - Johann Hari - 2023-02-15 22:16
  - The book was good, but not great.
  - the middle chapters from __simplistic Optimism__ were pretty interesting.
  - Could've skipped the initial chapter with the authors' story of trying to be less distracted. I suppose, it adds for a good narrative. But, didn't enlighten me as much as it could have.
- __Waiting for a Visa__ - BR Ambedkar - 2023-02-15 23:25
  - The stories are very moving and clarified a lot of misconception I had about Ambedkar's life.

  - Being a law man and a freedom fighter is a combination that is very much a necessity, if one is about to stand up against law.
  - Being solid about ones resolve is very important to go through the struggle.
  - Leader's source is people's trust over their decisions and their willingness to participate in it. Overpromisisng and not achieving goals erodes that trust. So, leader's have a dilemma of aggressively setting goals vs delivering the goals.
