    There‚Äôs lots of ways to be, as a person. And some people express their deep appreciation in different ways. But one of the ways that I believe people express their appreciation to the rest of humanity is to make something wonderful and put it out there. - Steve Jobs


```
Listen well everyone,
Great is the problem of life and death
No forever gone gone
Awake Awake each one
Don't waste your life
            - 1974 poem to a friend
```

```
‚ÄúYou never achieve what you want without falling on your face a few times.‚Äù
```

```
We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit. ‚Äì Aristotle
```
Although the above quote is not directly from Aristotle but from will durant misquoting aristotle. The essence of the quote still stands.

This book was an incredible read personally for me. Because I generally sneer at popular figures because I assume there was something wrong with them. But this has been a wonderful read, and despite all his faults steve did more good.
