>Listen well everyone,
>
> Great is the problem of life and death
>
> No forever gone gone
> 
>Awake Awake each one
> 
>Don't waste your life
            - 1974 poem to a friend


> “You never achieve what you want without falling on your face a few times.”

> We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit. – Aristotle

Although the above quote is not directly from Aristotle but from will durant misquoting aristotle. The essence of the quote still stands.

This book was an incredible read personally for me. Because I generally sneer at popular figures because I assume there was something wrong with them. But this has been a wonderful read, and despite all his faults steve did more good.
