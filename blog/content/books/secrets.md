dan brown books are special because "lost symbol" book release was how my wife and i started talking back in high school. so dan brown book releases hold a special place in our hearts. this book is even more special because my wife and i were in new york on the day of the book release and met dan brown at the barnes and nobles in union square, when we are expecting a baby. such a special moment for us.

that being said, i think non-langdon books from dan brown are much more interesting than langdon books. i especially love digital fortress and deception point before any of this. but seems like the court of public opinion loves langdon more.


the issue i have with langdon is that, they have a similar setup and a (IMO) deeply forced interweaving of symbolism in everything.


this book has exactly those elements. without the symbolism this was a perfectly logical sci-fi thriller book, and i respect the amount of effort . but since langdon is involved there are a lot of places were symbolism needs to come in.


the science behind this book is fantastic. the interweaving of neuroscience, computation, consciousness research is something that only dan brown can offer. you can feel the effort that went into each of those sections. even if i found some of the arguments presented a little too simplistic. eg. the fish bowl and stone argument for intertwining was very flimsy.


its a good mystery book, if you want a diverse book that digs deeper into the future of the world.
