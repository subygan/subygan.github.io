The growth of Paul into a sort of Genghis Khan style oppressive ruler was interesting. 

__Most times rulers are prisoners to their subjects as much as the subjects are to them__
Paul being helpless to control his army conquering and killing innocent people was interesting. It showed shades similar to the vikings' Ragnar Story. There is requirement for the ruler to die for the hoarde to be controlled in some sense. I had a hunch that, Paul would die as a partially unloved dictator.

This also reminded me that people on the helm always have trouble close by, similar to princess irulan scheming to kill paul all the while being his wife.

The ending was very matrix 3 ish for me. Paul loses his eyesight (neo also loses eyesight), sees using his "vision" (neo sees with his vision as well), Chani dies giving birth to a daughter (Trinity dies while giving birth to a daughter), in the end both the protagonists dies.

I liked the messiah more than dune, even though it seems like messiah was poorly received. messiah showed an environment where things are beyond an individual's controller, even if he's a god emperor.
