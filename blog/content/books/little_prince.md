Although a translation, this was a good book.
Maybe a little too platonic for my taste. But, still I'd suggest it as a short read.
To me personally, the Prince's Journey through different worlds where there were only one person living and he was the king, and others who were living in their own worlds, constantly working. The prince is incredibly confused about all the vain things that people do.
It is interesting the way the flower is portrayed as a naive character which is in constant need of protection, "guidance" and help. I guess that was the common caricaturization of a woman. Which, looking back is incredibly wrong (to me).
