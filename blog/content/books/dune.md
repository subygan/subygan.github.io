Dune was such a surprising read for me. I got interested in it after the movies, and I was blown away by the storyline.

It's very intricate and well woven.

## Dune

The conception of a wide universe with strong ground realities is incredible. A space-faring generation that is bottlenecked by production of a single raw material ("spice" in this case is interesting.)
Controlling Arrakis is the only important thing in the universe as it lets the controller squeeze the rest of the world.
While Leto Atreides fails, Paul gets his revenge and gets it back

The most fascinating angle to me was the Bene Gesserit angle where a tiny, insiduous, maternelistic group influences the universe as a whole and coordinate beyond generations.
To me, this was very similar to the "Swarm" by Bruce Sterling. I like this due the creation of something bigger than the individual at the cost of an individual itself. like, ants and bees

The plot being clear about addictiveness of spice, the shields, Worms being the ultimate entity, was all incredible.

Frank Herbert's depth in defining Fremen ideologies and survival capabilities were interesting. 

The "elites" (paul, lady jessica etc. ) being taught their subject's psychology was interesting. It somewhat corroborated with the crowd herding principles taught to leaders under closed doors
