## polynomials

when we represent the output of a function f(x) in the y axis and the input in the x axis we end up with the curve, depending on the function. The higher the number of curves, the higher the power of the polynomial.

All possible inputs are called __domain__ and all possible outputs are called __range__

## Sets

__cardinality__ number of elements present in a set. an empty set has cardinality zero and non-finite sets have infinite cardinality
__complement__ means all elements that are present in A, but not in B
A __Function__ is defined by a pair of I/O. {(a<sub>1</sub>,b<sub>1</sub>)} where a ∈ A and b ∈ B. Here we call A (set of inputs) as __domain__ and B (set of outputs) as __codomains__. and it is written as `f : A -> B`

When \\(a \\ne 0\\), there are two solutions to (ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ) and they are
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$

__preimage__ of b is denoted as
