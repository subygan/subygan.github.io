I usually like watching videos or brute force play for picking up skills. But, I wanted a comprehensive read on the topic and here we are. I learnt a lot more than I could've just by watching a video. Even though explaining some topics are definitely harder in a written medium.

### The Racket

Professional Rackets bend very less and don't twist when the cork hits on the sides. This means that the cork moves accurately irrespective where it hits in the bat. But, this also means that the bat is rigid and could break easily. 
Bats are of two sizes, isometric and rounded. Isometric shape increases the optimal hit area.

Grip diameter matters is critical, as it should make it easy to hold the bat. based on the hand wrap width. if the grip is too thick, the bat could fly off the hand.

It is important to be ready all the time and not let the bat be low. holding the bat at shoulder height reduces the reaction time.

### positions

The centre is the optimal position in the court. Coming back to the centre makes it easier to pick all types of shots. while picking shots from the back, it might become harder to come to the front. Which means, "scissor jumps" can be done to continue running as one lands. 

backhand shots are usually slow, hence they require a lot of practice or might end up in a botched shot.

In doubles, the pairs switch in clockwise and alternate between attacking and defending.

When the shuttle is tossed to the opposite court, the pair should get sideways to pick the smash.

Shots picked from below the hips are usually defensive and above the shoulders are offensive. In an ideal match, opponents switch between being offensive and defensive. One should know what is the dominant way of play for their style. Being defensive means you conserve energy and win by tiring the opponent down.  

Training should be done by focusing on fixing one aspect of the play. While holistic training is important as well. focused training is more important.
