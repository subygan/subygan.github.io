I've previously read Jeffrey Archer's other Short story collection, __Twelve Red Herrings__ and __The Collected Short Stories__. This collection lacked the "punch" factor that "Twelve Red Herrings". But, I still enjoyed all the stories.   

### death speaks
### the expert witness
### the endgame
### the letter
### crime pays
### chalk and cheese
### a change of heart
### too many coincidences
### love at first sight
### both sides against the middle
### a weekend to remember
### something for nothing
### other blighters' efforts
### the reclining woman
### the grass is always greener
