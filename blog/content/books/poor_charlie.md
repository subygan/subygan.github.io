I used to listen to Charlie Munger's psychology lectures a lot. So I had some idea what the book was going to be about, invert always invert, align incentives, do a simple thing consistently where ideas that I try to apply in my life. One of the things that I like a lot about charlie's view of life is how he focuses on perpetual, voracious learning. Being able to adapt to changing market winds and guiding such a huge investment portfolio at the age of 99 is just something that inspires me in a quite unique way.

### the latticework 

At the heart of Munger's philosophy lies the concept of "worldly wisdom." He argues that to make good decisions, one must have a broad understanding of the big ideas from the major disciplines: psychology, economics, physics, biology, and history, among others. Relying on a single field of knowledge is like a man with only a hammer, to whom every problem looks like a nail.

To combat this narrow-mindedness, Munger says one should have a "latticework of mental models." that helps us understand the world. 
Munger's revolutionary idea was to not just collect these models, but to weave them into an interconnected framework in your mind. This latticework allows you to view problems from multiple perspectives, leading to more informed and robust decisions. Munger believed that having about 80 to 90 important models will carry about 90% of the freight in making you a worldly-wise person.

The power of this approach he says is that it helps to reduce the chaos of a complex problem into a set of understandable fundamentals. By hanging your experiences, both direct and vicarious, on this latticework of theory, you begin to see the interconnectedness of ideas and develop a more holistic understanding of reality.

Although this is a really inspiring idea. The problem for me personally is, how it's unclear how to gain the "latticework" or, how to keep in touch with the latticework. For example I read a ton of books, the idea itself gets outdated/disproved etc. Which means, I end up with a piece of my latticework rotten away. In a lot of cases, keeping upto date with the latticework is itself a full time job. Basically I'm unclear how to keep my latticework clean.

### inversion

One of Munger's most powerful and counterintuitive mental models is the principle of "inversion". "Invert, always invert" is his most popular quote. Instead of asking how to achieve a goal, Munger would first ask what would cause failure and then diligently avoid those pitfalls. This is (to me) a profound shift in perspective which forces a consideration of potential obstacles and leads to more resilient strategies.

Although, its an interesting idea. Thinking about failures too much also tends to create (for me) a vortex of negativity where I end up sinking. So I try to use this inversion angle as a guardrail as opposed to the map to reach my goal.

Charlie gives example of mathematician Carl Jacobi, whom Munger often quoted, said, "Invert, always invert." By thinking about a problem in reverse, it often becomes easier to solve. For instance, instead of asking "How can I help my business succeed?", one might ask "What would cause my business to fail?" By identifying and then avoiding those causes, the path to success becomes clearer. This approach helps in identifying and steering clear of what Munger called "standard stupidities."

### cognitive flaws

Munger placed immense importance on understanding psychology, particularly the predictable ways in which humans can be irrational. He developed a comprehensive checklist of 25 standard causes of human misjudgment, which he considered one of his most important contributions. These psychological tendencies, often working at a subconscious level, can lead to significant errors in judgment.

Some of the key tendencies Munger identified include:

*   **Reward and Punishment Superresponse Tendency:** This is the idea that incentives and disincentives are incredibly powerful drivers of behavior. As Benjamin Franklin said, "If you would persuade, appeal to interest and not to reason." Munger warned of "incentive-caused bias," where people, consciously or subconsciously, drift into immoral behavior to get what they want.
*   **Liking/Loving Tendency:** We tend to ignore the faults of and comply with the wishes of people we like.
*   **Disliking/Hating Tendency:** This is the opposite of the liking/loving tendency, where we are blinded to the virtues of those we dislike.
*   **Doubt-Avoidance Tendency:** The human brain is reluctant to change, which is a form of inconsistency avoidance. We tend to quickly remove doubt by making a decision.
*   **Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency:** We are reluctant to change our habits, beliefs, and conclusions. This is why, as Franklin noted, "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure," as it's much easier to prevent a bad habit than to change it.
*   **Social Proof Tendency:** Humans have an automatic tendency to think and act as they see others around them thinking and acting, especially in times of uncertainty or stress.
*   **Over-optimism Tendency:** We are naturally inclined to be overly optimistic, which can lead to underestimating risks.

I used to have a large list of psychological biases that I've recognised, but seem like I've lost it to the digital rot. If I find some time to dig through my documents and find I'll fill it here.

### virtues

Beyond the intellectual frameworks, "Poor Charlie's Almanack" comes with a strong moral and ethical compass. Munger championed virtues like preparation, discipline, patience, and decisiveness. He believed in the power of continuous learning, famously stating, "Spend each day trying to be a little wiser than you were when you woke up." For Munger, the acquisition of wisdom was a moral duty.

He also emphasized the importance of integrity, honesty, and owning up to one's mistakes. Morality and ethics were not just abstract concepts for Munger; they were fundamental to long-term success in both business and life. He believed that in the long run, most people get what they deserve.

### key takeaways 

"Poor Charlie's Almanack" is not a book to be passively read; it's a manual for active thinking. Here are some of the key takeaways to incorporate into your own life:

*   **Build Your Latticework:** Actively seek out the big ideas from various disciplines. Don't just learn isolated facts; connect them in a meaningful way.
*   **Invert, Always Invert:** When faced with a problem, think about it backward. What are the things you want to avoid?
*   **Know Your Biases:** Study the psychology of human misjudgment. Understanding your cognitive blind spots is the first step to overcoming them.
*   **Stay Within Your Circle of Competence:** Acknowledge the limits of your own knowledge and expertise. It's better to be smart in a few areas than to be a know-it-all.
*   **Be a Lifelong Learner:** Cultivate an insatiable curiosity and make learning a daily habit. As Munger said, "I constantly see people rise in life who are not the smartest, sometimes not even the most diligent, but they are learning machines."
*   **Practice Patience and Discipline:** Long-term success is built on a foundation of patience and disciplined decision-making. The big money, Munger noted, is not in the buying and selling, but in the waiting.

In a world of increasing complexity and specialization, the wisdom of Charlie Munger is quite relevant. and I like how simple he makes it.
