My place on the internet. Where I record my learnings, thoughts and ideas.

I Love reading and experimenting with Distributed and embedded systems.

I'm currently doing my Masters in Privacy Engineering at CMU, and my research is on the intersection between Machine Learning, Privacy and Systems Software.

I enjoy meeting new people. So definitely send a shout-out to me at, hi at suriya.cc. 🙂
