My place on the internet. Where I record my learnings, thoughts and ideas.

I Love reading and experimenting with Distributed and embedded systems.

I'm currently a privacy Engineering Graduate at CMU, and I'm currently working on the intersection between Machine Learning, Privacy and Systems Software.
I'm also __looking for an internship for Summer 2024__.

I enjoy meeting new people. So definitely send a shout-out to me at, hi at suriya.cc. 🙂
