My place on the internet. Where I record my learnings, thoughts and ideas.

I Love to read and experiment with Distributed and embedded systems.

I'm currently a privacy Engineering Graduate at CMU and Work on Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETS) such as Federated
Learning.

When I'm not banging my head against my Monitor with unworkable code, I love reading books. 

I enjoy meeting new people. So definitely send a shout out to me at, hi at suriya.cc. 🙂
