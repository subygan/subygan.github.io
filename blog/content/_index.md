My place on the internet. Where I record my learnings, thoughts and ideas.
I Love to read and experiment with Distributed and embedded systems.
I'm currently a privacy Engineering Graduate at CMU and Work on Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETS) such as Federated
Learning.
When I'm not banging my head against my Monitor with unworkable code, I love reading books. And I enjoy meeting new people 
Send a hi to me at hi at suriya.cc. 🙂
