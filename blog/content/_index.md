Hi! 👋

I'm Suriya (pronounced Soo-r-ya)

I'm an Engineer, who loves to write. Suffice to say, I write here when I'm trying to think through something or when I've solved something.

I'm currently doing my Masters in Privacy Engineering at CMU, and my research is on the intersection between Machine Learning, Privacy and Systems Software.

I Love reading and experimenting with Distributed and embedded systems.

I enjoy meeting new people. So definitely send a shout-out to me at, hi at suriya.cc. 🙂
