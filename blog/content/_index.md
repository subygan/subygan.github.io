My place on the internet. Where I record my learnings, thoughts and ideas.

I Love to read and experiment with Distributed and embedded systems.

I'm currently a privacy Engineering Graduate at CMU, and I've worked on Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETS) such as Polymorphic Encryption and Federated
Learning.

When I'm not banging my head against my Monitor with unworkable code, I love reading books. 

I enjoy meeting new people. So definitely send a shout-out to me at, hi at suriya.cc. 🙂
