        <p><span>I&#39;ve been trying to learn Golang. Golang is such a charm to work with. The tooling feels like, it&#39;s been developed with all the learnings and shortcomings of previous languages.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span>For example, There are </span><strong><span>no unused variables</span></strong><span>. Although it&#39;s annoying to see error thrown when compiling for unused variables at first. It quickly becomes obvious. Similarly </span><code>go fmt</code><span> tool is used to format go code. Making sure that the code is formatted as expected and there aren&#39;t a million different guidelines (which people barely follow). I personally think this method is better</span>
        </p>
        <p><span>Everything is made to just work out of the box. No riff raff. </span><code>go mod vendor</code><span> and just compiling works flawlessly. Looking at python and js. This is plain incredible to work with.</span>
