### Experiment1 - Time based "focus" segments

I generally don't believe timing, focus is a bad way of doing it because. The belief is that, when you are in "focus", you forget time and get all into it. But, this happens very rarely and hard to replicate.

At least in the short term, I strongly believe that I can gain a lot by segmenting my time.

#### Method
- Setup counter for a maximum of 2 hrs.
- Phone should be kept in silent mode or left in a place where there is little to no access
- Breaks aren't (usually allowed). Unavoidable scenarios are fine. More than 3 breaks in a session would count as a faulty session.

### Why focus?

operating on two different things, usually takes 3 times the time it would take. This is majorly due to the context switch overhead. Focusing on one thing at a time, is very much required to make sure I dig deep into the problem

### Frequent distractions:

These are my frequent distractions these days.
