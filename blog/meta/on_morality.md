title: On Morality
description: It seems morality really does not matter and whoever manages to claw up the capital ladder, are lauded as pioneers and mavericks. Is morality up for sale then? what is the cost of morality?

The whole world seems to be running on this flywheel of pump and dump schemes and it doesn't seem to matter as long the future is far enough.

[Elon Musk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk) The guy behind tesla, spaceX and other moonshot companies is an interesting study. For a sect of faithful followers he's an engineer of unmatchable intelligence and insight into everything ranging from [mars exploration](https://www.spacex.com/human-spaceflight/mars/) to [synthetic brain chips](https://neuralink.com/). Which... To be honest, sounds a lot like a [PT Barnum humbug](http://www.ptbarnum.org/humbugs.html), to say the least. I don't believe any single person could rapidly be innovating on such wide array of fields, even if said person is an insane genius. Is Musk a good business man? definitely But a unrivaled genius, he probably is not. But where he really excels though, is showmanship. And it works, Tesla is [valued more than the top 5 rival cars combined](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-market-cap-eclipses-that-top-5-rival-carmakers-combined-2021-10-26/). Which is insane, considering that, tesla delivered about 1 million vehicles in 2021, while the next rival Toyota alone accounts for 9 million cars delivered that year. This is apparently because tesla's self driving is a "game changer", "the first 100 trillion dollar company", and "could change robotics forever". If some twitter ramblings are to be believed. Musk has a cult like following, despite it's "Full self driving" being insanely bad and [other issues](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2021-12-20/editorial-slam-the-breaks-on-teslas-self-driving-madness).

Is Elon Musk a techno-optimist engineer? or is he just pumping everything up so he can sell ["FSD"](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/tech-bytes/tesla-raises-full-self-driving-software-price-to-12000-in-us-elon-musk-says/articleshow/88771439.cms?from=mdr) way before it is close to even ready? Does he know internally the risk that tesla cars could face, when an accident happens? It's hard to say for sure. And therein lies the catch, there are a lot of supposed leaders selling a lot of stories, way before anything becomes profitable or even workable. It seems everybody is following [No profit, No problem](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonmarkman/2017/05/23/the-amazon-era-no-profits-no-problem/?sh=698f6b19437a). Which is an insane thing considering that, most companies are just building & selling  stuff in the left all the while hoping it can hype up enough to IPO with an exit. A typical example is [Embark trucks](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-11/embark-trucks-embk-stock-now-public-led-by-26-year-old-ceo). They barely have a working prototype on the roads, before lunging for an IPO. clearly hyping up with the founder story and such PR hoodwinks to make you believe this truly is something special.

There are similar things happenign all around tecg, other stellar examples include [zomato](https://www.chittorgarh.com/ipo/zomato-ipo/1126/), [paytm](https://www.chittorgarh.com/ipo/paytm-ipo/1128/), [nykaa](https://www.chittorgarh.com/ipo/nykaa-ipo/1170/) and many many others. All of which are loss making businesses. With profitability so far away in the future that, it is impossible to predict. Now, if you ask any of these founders, there are going to be incredible talks about how CAC is reducing while business is "scaling" and Market is growing and how they are the market leader in said field. My biggest question is, Are these leaders even being true to themselves or is it just part of the pump? It's obvious that as leader of the company they need + have that naively overambitious idea. But, it is also true that it is to their benefit to say such thing, irrespective of how everything is portrayed.

I'm at a quandry here. I think the SEC, __requires__ you to disclose all information before going public and stay true to it. Anything else, exposes you to litigation. But, these founders just word it just enough to push over the edge. does this mean that, it is okay sell oneself just because it would give me monetary benefits? Is it fine to portray oneself as a giddy optimist, all the while having hundreds of doubts about the success of a business. I am just as confused as I've ever been
