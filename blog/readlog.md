- [There's something off about apecoin](https://www.platformer.news/p/theres-something-off-about-apecoin?)
  - Very interesting idea of thinking tokens like a easily cashable equity. I'm guessing this is one of the ways to side step the regulatory authority prohibiting early stage companies from doing IPOs willy nilly. Which also makes sense that so many VCs want companies to be web3 ones. they're just easily cashable, not because the underlying tech is awesome, but the law has no idea about this, yet.

## 2022-03-10

- [Squirrel burgers](https://ghuntley.com/squirrel-burgers/)
  - Software engineering is very flimsy about __who__ is able to write code. Most other profession has standards and licensing for who can work on what.
  - The flip side of this argument is that, this would allow a huge gatekeeping bias. So, people on the other side of the fence would be safe, while this side would still be struggling.

- [Lizard brain is no match for endless feed](https://alexanderell.is/posts/infinite-scroll/)
  - There are some interesting ways people are tackling this problem,
    - A button near the desk, which when pressed removes all distraction-sites from the custom DNS config for the next 45 or so minutes.
    - A geo-fenced smart phone app button which would only enable distraction-sites for the next 15 or so minutes.
  
- [traditional b2b sales is dead, long live the uce](https://kellblog.com/2022/03/06/traditional-b2b-sales-is-dead-long-live-the-uce/)
  - b2b sales has been recently evolved into Product Led Growth (PLG). Which means the product speaks for itself, the author is right now wondering if it is moving to a model called Unified commercial engine
  - Irrespective of the specific details of UCE, the theory in the preface about how information has changed marketing and sales is very interesting

## 2022-03-06

- [actor turned crypto naysayer](https://www.thecut.com/article/benjamin-mckenzie-crypto-profile.html?ref=refind)

## 2022-03-04

- [memory caches and shared memory](https://www.eidos.ic.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~tau/lecture/parallel_distributed/2018/slides/pdf/memory2.pdf)

## 2022-03-03

- [A world without blockchain \[video\]](https://media.ccc.de/v/33c3-8315-a_world_without_blockchain#t=654)
  - An interesting keyhole view into how the international monetary transactions works. I'm pretty much convinced that blockchain could solve this problem. The way right now is that there are a lot of hops between exchanges at the national level and international level with a lot of implicit trust, to move money around. I think blockchain could replace the chain of trust with a simple API. 
  - But then, the fluctuating/increasing transaction fee + reducing mined amount is pretty worrysome. If not BTC I think something from the blockchain playbook has the potential to change it.

While, in 21st century ‚Äúattention economy‚Äù is a big part of the process. So, basically the argument goes that, Something that might not be valuable right now, might turn out to be something of pretty intense value in hindsight. For example, rearing children, taking care of older parents, cleaning ones house all of these have clear economic value, But not counted as value in most places. Similarly, what other things aren‚Äôt we counting towards economic value right now, but over time might turn out to be valuable, are NFTs something like that??

  - Most linux operations can be made on both folders but. deleting the symlink does not delete the target. `mv` and `cp` works the same way
  - _Question: can symlink type thing be done between two files over an NFS?_
- [How Big is 2<sup>256</sup> 3B1B \[Video\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9JGmA5_unY){:target="_blank"}
  - Its incredible how easy it is to forget, just how big some numbers are.
  - I guess the law of large numbers still applies.
- [RSS vs Atom](http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/Rss20AndAtom10Compared){:target="_blank"}
  - Pretty good points. 
  - It's interesting how protocols need to be non-private or copyrighted to usually work.
  - I think, Privatizing a protocol is very analogous to privatizing english or spanish. It just won't work. Languages and protocols need to be free and open for mass adoption. and without that the protocols.

- [Avoiding internet centralisation](https://mnot.github.io/avoiding-internet-centralization/draft-nottingham-avoiding-internet-centralization.html){:target="_blank"}
  - Types of cenralization
    - __Direct centralisation__ - eg. chat, messaging and videoconferencing protocol use this method
    - __Neessary centralisation__ - eg. DNS, Certificate Authority (CA){:target="_blank"} due to technical limitations. 
    - __Indirect Centralization__ - In theory all nodes in the Internet are equivalent. But realistically some nodes drive much of the traffic of the internet
    - __Inherited Centralization__ - The network between two endpoints is a few stack below the OSI model. But whoever controls the network basically has control over the internet as well
    - __Platform Centralisation__ - While the protocol itself doesn't maintain centralization. It enables centralised service providers to have more control Over others. eg HTTP
  - __Limits of Decentralisation__ - there is no completely decentralised system. Although there has been some attempt at it. Centralisation starts evolving
    - __Federation is not enough__ - SMTP was evolved as a method to have a decentralised way to receive message even when the underlying Network, IP or the server changes. One way it is done is, The DNS handles the finding the user part and the Mail Transfer Agent (MTA){:target="_blank"} can be used to route message to anyone. But this has created a situation where there are Indirectly centralised systems like Gmail. Who have much better network effects and are able to elbow other small players away.
    - __Multi-Stakeholder Administration is hard__ - This is a model of centralisation where Multiple representatives from various stakeholders come together to decide on something. For example ICANN, CA, Browser Forum. These are a type of centralization but in some ways they are less centralised, as well
    - __Blockchains are not magical__ - Blockchains try to reduce centralization risk by distributing intermediary or otherwise potentially centralized functions to members of a large pool of protocol participants. The assignment of a task usually cannot be controlled (to avoid sybill attacks){:target="_blank"}. These prevent _direct centralization, inherited centralisation_. There are a few issues with this though
      - __Distributed consensus protocols can have significant implications for privacy.__ Because all activities are shared with many unknown parties. Private Information Retrieval is incredibly (PIR){:target="_blank"} is incredibly easy
      - A lot communication back and forth + proof-of-work makes the whole network inefficient,
      - Distributed consensus protocol are still __not proven to scale__.
      - Responsibilities are diffused to certain unknown parties in the network. Making, control and management very difficult.
    - It is also possible that centralisation risk can happen elsewhere, eg, bitcoin trading places

  - Basically new files can be mounted and unmounted based on the reuqirements.
  - There is a `/etc/mnttab` file that keeps track fo the file system
- [How signal does end-to-end encrypted group video calls ](https://signal.org/blog/how-to-build-encrypted-group-calls/){:target="_blank"}
  - Signal engineering is pretty good. 
  - the article goes into detail on how they handle key rotations on the fly and how signal makes sure that even the media forwarding servers that optimise content delivery are not able to view the data in calls.
  - It's pretty good.

  - Bottomline: Somebody's using the blockchain as a resiliency platform to host botnet. So, when some authority removes the botnet. the botnet never goes away because it lives in the blockchain. Interesting and a more realistic use case for blockchain, I've seen so far

  - An interesting take on how an inside of a spec creation looks.
  - The guys discuss about how to create a bounce and elastic easing. using bezier curves and why there can't be more than one output per line and how they solved that problem and how it made it difficult to do spring effect and how that was solved.
