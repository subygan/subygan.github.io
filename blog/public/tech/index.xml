      <description>Theory seems more and more important, as I try to understand the underlying blocks. It&amp;rsquo;s not enough to just know frameworks, I need to know the underlying assumptions and working of hte building blocks. These are all my experiments.
What constitutes theory? Anything that helps me understand a system. Not necessarily just to operate on. This can range from compilers to database to pretty much anything theoretical.</description>

      <description>This is still a WIP and I&amp;rsquo;ll be updating each one as I discover and play with new stuff.
Why Cross platform? There are majorly 2 mobile platforms and 3 desktop platforms. Browsers are acting as a cool layer between this, within the realms of which applications are consistently rendered and usability is not spoilt. This is awesome, because now you don&amp;rsquo;t need 5X the development effort to deliver a software experience But only one.</description>
