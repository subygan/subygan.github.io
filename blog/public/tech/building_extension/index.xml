      <description>an Unknown error occured while fetching the script. This happens when trying to load the extension. the manifest.json was pointing to the right service worker but still couldn&amp;rsquo;t fetch it. The problem was that there was some import error or other issue in the service-worker script. I fixed it and the whole thing loaded like a breeze.
