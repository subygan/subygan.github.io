<p>Learning docker, a little deeper this time.</p>
<h3 id="docker-daemon">Docker Daemon</h3>
<p>docker daemon is at the center of everything and it exposes REST apis. this is what is used by docker clients ot pull images and stuff.
The <code>dockerd</code> demon listens for docker api requests and manages</p>
<h3 id="docker-client">Docker client</h3>
<p>The docker client (<code>docker</code>) is the primary way that many Docker users interact with docker. <strong>When a command such as <code>docker run</code> is run. the client sends these commands to <code>docker</code>, which carries out them out.</strong></p>
<p>This illustration from  <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/">Docker docs</a> is really helpful</p>
<p><img src="dockerd.png" alt="Dockerd representation" title="Dockerd"></p>
<h3 id="docker-desktop">Docker Desktop</h3>
<p>The docker Desktoop is an easy to install docker setup platform, it comes out of the box with <em>docker daemon</em> (<code>dockerd</code>) and <em>Dcoker client</em> (<code>docker</code>), docker compose, Docker content tryst, kubernetes and Credential Helper.</p>
<h2 id="docker-objects">Docker Objects</h2>
<p>When docker is used, we are creating and using images, containers, networks, columes, plugins and other objects.</p>
<h3 id="images">Images</h3>
<p>An image is a <strong>read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container</strong>. Often, an image is basedon another image, with some additional customization. For example, you may build an image which is based on the <code>ubuntu</code> image. but installs Apache web server and your application as well as the configuration details needed to make your application run.</p>
<p>You might create your own images or you might only use those created by others and published in a registry. To build you own image you create a Dockerfile with simple syntax for defining the steps needed to create the image and run it.</p>
<p><strong>Each instruction in a Dockerfile creates a layer in the images. When the dockerfile is changed and the image is rebuilt, only the layers which have changed are rebuilt.</strong></p>
<h3 id="containers">Containers</h3>
<p><strong>A container is a runnable instance of an image.</strong> You can <strong>create, start, stop, move or delete</strong> a container using the docker API or cli. You can connect a container to one or more networks, attach storage to it, or even create a new image based on its current state.</p>
<p>Containers are relatively well isolated from other containers and its host machine.</p>
<p>A container is defined by its image as well as any configuration options you provide to it when you create or start it. When a container is removed any changes to its state that are not stored in persistent storage disapear.</p>
<h3 id="example-docker-run-command">Example <code>docker run</code> command</h3>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>docker run -i -t ubuntu /bin/bash
</code></pre><p>The following happens for the above command</p>
<ul>
<li>if the <code>ubuntu</code> image is not locally available, docker pulls it from the configured registry.</li>
<li>Docker allocates a read-write filesystem to the container, as its final layer. This allows a running container to create or modify files and directories in its local filesystem.</li>
<li>Docker creates a network interface to connect the container to the default network, since no networking options were provided. This includes <strong>assingning an IP address to the container</strong>.</li>
<li>Docker starts the container and executes <code>/bin/bash</code>, Because the container is running interactively and attached to your terminal (due to the <code>-i</code> and <code>-t</code> flags).</li>
</ul>
