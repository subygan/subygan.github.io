<p>I generally don&rsquo;t believe timing, focus is a bad way of doing it because. The belief is that, when you are in &ldquo;focus&rdquo;, you forget time and get all into it. But, this happens very rarely and hard to replicate.</p>
<p>At least in the short term, I strongly believe that I can gain a lot by segmenting my time.</p>
<h4 id="method">Method</h4>
<ul>
<li>Setup counter for a maximum of 2 hrs.</li>
<li>Phone should be kept in silent mode or left in a place where there is little to no access</li>
<li>Breaks aren&rsquo;t (usually allowed). Unavoidable scenarios are fine. More than 3 breaks in a session would count as a faulty session.</li>

<h3 id="why-focus">Why focus?</h3>
<p>operating on two different things, usually takes 3 times the time it would take. This is majorly due to the context switch overhead. Focusing on one thing at a time, is very much required to make sure I dig deep into the problem</p>

<p>These are my frequent distractions these days.</p>
