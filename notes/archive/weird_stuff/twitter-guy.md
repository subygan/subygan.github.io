[found this guy on twitter](https://twitter.com/SiddharthaModa2/with_replies) Spent about 30 minutes scrolling through his 2331 tweets. 

He's tweeting at celebrities ~ 6 tweets a day  wth stuff that goes like

```
Dear Sir, will you be my Business investor for 5 years please ??🙏
#Investment needed = $500k dollars.
I've lost all the hopes and feeling to do #Suicide at the moment because of this Financial crisis.😪
Please support my manufacturing sector and Save my Family & Business both.🙏
```

there is just endless feeds of it, not sure what to make out of it.
first tweet is jun7,2021 and I noticed in 14 Aug 2022
he has some emotional speaking facebook page as well

first tweet,
to salman khan
``
Sir, I'm Siddhartha Modak from Assam Silchar. Due Covid facing huge financial loss and crisis in my business. Don't know how to come out and also trying to interact with all. If you support me as an investor for my business than with in next few years I'll recover all the losses.
``

questions, 
- if he is a bot, why only 6 tweets a day?
- he posts his credentials like dl and aadhar.
- The progression of the amount of money needed is 1 Cr => 120 lacs => 2 Cr => 250K => 1 M
- Does this scheme actually create money
- Is this like the scalable way of begging for money in the physical world?
- How many people does it take to maintain 100 accounts?
