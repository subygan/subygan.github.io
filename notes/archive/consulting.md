Why do consulting?

- Build development muscle that is becoming hard on your own
- Enforced deadlines pushing ourselves to deliver.
- Exposure to more senior people
- Network?

Why not self?

- Due to lax deadlines, I work much slower.
- There is no real enforcement.
- Tried and failed multiple times.

Why now?

- I need to build more  and I should've been doing it yesterday.
- I can learn from collaboration with others.
