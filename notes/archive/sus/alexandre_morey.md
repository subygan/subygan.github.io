Hi Harvey, 

Hope you are well. l'd like your opinion on an idea I am trying to validate (or not). 

I am wondering if a http://focusmate.com like website could work for corporate. 

This product is for companies working remotely. 54 min session of virtual co-working with a random co-worker from your company. 

How it would work:
2 min: introducing each other and explaining what task they will be working on. 
50 min: mic off, camera on, beeing focus and working on the task. 
2 min: debriefing => how did the session go? Did they managed to accomplish their task? They answer briefly and hang up. 

This products helps with : Accountability, productivity, motivation, networking, good for mental health. 

How do you think I can validate this idea? I am trying to do an MVP using Ruby on Rails but as I am a junior developer it's taking a lot of time. Do you know if there is a more efficient way for me to find out if this is a product market fit? How would you execute on this idea? 

I have also tried cold calling potential clients to see if they were interested in pre orders (so I could finance the project) but it's difficult to just sell an idea. 

Many thanks, 
Alex
