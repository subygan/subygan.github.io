## Staying Positive

In, general it is much,much easier being the Pessimist in the room, the armchair-defeatist, pointing fingers and listing out the issues. It is much harder and requires a lot more Imagination to be an optimist when everything is bleak and there is no ray of hope.
I have to accept that, Optimism for all its sugar-coated-ness is a rarely available resource and hence has to be nurtured.

Being positive is a good type of placebo that leads to good effects. irrespective, of the actual situation, smiling is good for ourselves as well as the people around us.

Obviously it is good to think of the negative side of things. But the default should always be being positive. This is similar to the idea behind `Occams razor` it is better to assume ignorance than maleficence
