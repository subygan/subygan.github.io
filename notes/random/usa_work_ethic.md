## Thoughts on indian and US systems

We are working the same way we were doing our homework. Clueless as to why we do homework, why there is so many of them. We just do it, on and on perpetually, in a kafka-esque delirium.

but these children have way less homework than we did, they have 4 months of holidays per year (excluding saturday sundays), and generally spend less number of days inside classrooms.

I think one of the major reason is that, the current managerial class (people around our parents' age) are all products of an education and parenting system that was prioritising obedience and servility over freedom and comfort. Nobody plans seriously, or thinks into the future, we're just stuck in the infinite now, doing work we shouldn't be doing, because we don't questions the mob.

Roopini was exactly right when she said, that nobody says "no, I won't do this." because we were never taught that saying fuck off might be a good life strategy. everyone, collectively just compromises and compromises until everybody is looking at the end of an empty pot.

These kids have a air of control about them, they are just very free. they are encouraged to do things that their parents won't or don't do. They have their own cars, credit cards, rooms and handle their own chores. Their imagination is a little more unbirdled than ours. I don't think, I would've ever thought about building a school in a remote, unseen village and done some serious research about it or even done a precursor to it.
