The world is aligned in a way such that there are a few central entities who are constantly evolving and creating narratives.
These are the hot spots where, a handful few have control over an asymmetrically huge population.
For caste system to exist __and__ thrive. the super powerful have to delegate some power to people one step below them and it should be hierarchical. Because the people in the middle should always feel like they are gaining the privilege to be in their layer where there are people below them. this pyramid like structure keeps the power structure going.
Similarly, a lot of people are just parroting what others are saying because original thoughts are very difficult to come by. It is much easier to parrot what ideology/concept that the people in the centre are saying (personal anecdote: remember that guy saying steve jobs example of nike.) The problem with parroting though, is that without having a fundamental understanding of what might be happening it would be very difficult to comprehend and execute. It is like you have the input and you have the output. But, you don't know how it was arrived so, making it effectively useless because you can't derive something similar.
