If you are not passionate about it. Just don't.
I used to think passion in the sense that, You'd do something even if you don't get paid.
It's something that you've been observing, pouring abnormal amount of time into and have been doing without any reward. These could be something you've been researching or working in professionally. And, it obviously goes without saying that not all such activities would have to be "exponentially fruitful". This is basically what paul graham's [bus ticket theory of genius](http://www.paulgraham.com/genius.html) describes.
