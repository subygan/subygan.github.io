- People are generally very happy and smiley. Everybody says hi when you walk or make eye contact.
- Everything is effortlessly intense. from the sugar in the drinks to the conversations with people. 
- It is very weird to see someone walk while sipping their Extra chocolate mocha or eating their donut. It is as if like, a whole country has leaned on high sugar, fat, and salt at the same time.
- People are Very aware about their environment and are very receptive to price changes, new constructions, events and happenings. most of the conversations are about that.
- Dust is very less. Cars are just parked outside homes, without any dust.
- It is very impossible to survive without a car. Even though, there are cycle and pedestrian paths everywhere everything is placed apart far enough that you need a car anyway. 
- Generally people are more industrious. I see a donation rack for books fill up everyday, people of all ages, carry huge bags of books and come here for the sole purpose of dropping these books off. people go a long distance and separate out their trash for them to be reusable.
- Library is usually filled with people.
