### Purdue University Visit

Purdue was a very cool university to visit. They had 60K students. And wide fields, from kinesthesiology to flight programs to nanotechnology. 12:1 student teacher ratio. I guess because of this sprawl, they don't specialise in very many things. So, they're not very "academic" in the sense like creating or generating cutting edge things. But, they're good at transferring almost cutting knowledge onto students because that is what they do best. If we think of educational institutions as expanding human knowledge about something, and then transmitting it back to society. I guess universities are like transmission amplifiers. They are able to get the most recent of these knowledge and propagate it back to students. But, as we go down this ladder, we will be seeing higher and higher latency colleges where they're going to trade in more and more stale data.
