Making people explore something new is very difficult. There is a certain comfort in dependability. Mcdonald's dependability makes going to them, more valuable than an unknown cafe X because it might even be bad.
Americans... as a culture have somehow convinced a critical volume of people that, it is okay to explore and do novel new things. Every person I see, tries very very hard to stand out. They do things that are non-normal. it is encouraged, culturally. At least more encouraged than in India. And this creates a lot of new ideas and constant changes to happen. When a new product/service/idea comes out, americans seem like people who are more likely to try it out than the people in my hometown. Even if something could create a problem. This is critical, because people are willing to bet on something totally unknown and new.
