## micro ideas

- chat widget for websites connected with slack
- Github bot to figure out dead links in a repo
- Github CI failure notifications for PRs I raised, in a private message in slack
- wedding photo album for easy sharing.
  - Would be useful with posterity and sharability
- View someone's twitter profile in reverse order, i.e. oldest tweet first.
  - Not a lot of tools exist right now
