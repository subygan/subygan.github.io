## micro ideas

- chat widget for websites connected with slack
- Github bot to figure out dead links in a repo
- Github CI failure notifications for PRs I raised, in a private message in slack
- wedding photo album for easy sharing.
  - Would be useful with posterity and sharability
- View someone's twitter profile in reverse order, i.e. oldest tweet first.
  - Not a lot of tools exist right now
- Hovering widget app with timer + schedule in mac
- **focusmate for exam preparing**
  - There could be seperate cohorts who are trying to prepare for separate exams.
  - This is better than focusmate, because those who match would have a shared context
- Update extension
- Extension to convert any audio/video to text.
- Using the same idea as the clock in email thing. But, it can be used to serve advertisements in news letters
