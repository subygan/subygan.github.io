### PrepMate

Aspirants who are preparing for exams are heavily moving towards remote preparation. Barring the exceptional few, it is hard to keep motivation alive. and work and work and work.

PrepMate is a focusmate fork, specialised for exam preparation. People who are preparing for exams can schedule preparation sessions with each other and match with random people (or people from their own milieu) And Setup prepsession with them. When the time comes, people will be allowed to access the video call. Both parties can introduce themselves and their goals and then mute each other and work for 45 - 90 minutes. After that, there can be an optional discussion to go over each other's notes or maybe in discuss light stuff.
