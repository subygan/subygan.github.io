## Tell us about something you've done in the past that can be considered as evidence of exceptional ability

When there was leadership churn at my first job at a Series C funded Startup. My skip level director left and delegated his tasks to my manager, who also left 2 months later. I stepped up, managed and coordinated around 7 - 10 releases a week for the next 6 months across 8 different teams in a monolithic rust codebase. I had to develop a lot of technical and interpersonal skill in a short amount of time to deal with the intricacies.
