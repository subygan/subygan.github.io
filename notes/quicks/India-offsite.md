# SALES

- Doing the hard work of making synergetic product is helpful + creates moat.
    - Think aws or gcp with non-synergetic products where everything is just fragmented and non-synergetic.
    - Synergetic products wins all the time. eg. salesforce (better integration with multiple products)

# Saas-terms

### ARR

- ARR

Total Contract value TCV = sum of all money of the contract

These contracts are bankable, in the US, meaning they can be borrowed against. Usuallly, contract has clause for usage based increment. TCV is the amount the company pays, "come what may".

Upsells => usage, feature expansion, different cases.

### Average Contract value ACV:

(TCV year 1 + TCV year 2 <which could be higher>)/2  


### Average Sales Price ASP

Total Revenue/no. of customer

<ASP means too many customers to acquire 
>ASP means too little customers and lumpy

### Sales pipeline:

mraketing team => (collects, using SEO linkeidn, twitter, sponsorships, talks etc) => MQLs => Sales people contact the MQLs => Customer discovery (BGV, capability etc) => Sales negotiation => Contract

pull sales vs outreach => them coming to us vs us ot them.

note:
- Isolation of expertise is important for companies. eg, people trust skyflow to be good at PII but might not trust ingrown privacy products by the same company.

# Customer Implementations:

- Always appreciate people, and double highlight the positives and absorb all the negatives.

# Product Implementations (2022-09-28):

- Skyflow => privacy cloud
- User table should be isolated
ltv => build teh platform that helps our customers use their customer data with privacy and security

- "Customer service use cases" => simpler to do.
- Skyflow + snowflake partnership => Deeper integration with data analytics.
- SF + okta => data residency for equifax.
- Skyflow + Segment => extract customer data before the customer sends data to skyflow before sending to segment to isolate PII. Also DR
- Not chasing partnerships aggressively. Accept it, as they come.
- Gradual disclosure.
- How will customers have (or be ready for) the exact architecture that we expect them to have. Won't there be an adoption valley. (look at shopify Google Docs)
- Monthly burn 1.8 Mil, Contracting expenses
