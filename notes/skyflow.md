## Polymorphic Encryption

Break down the data into multiple parts depending on the context, which lets us run aggregate queries
Phone number, can be broken down into multiple

## Homomorphic Encryption
homomorphic encryption scheme allows homomorphic operation on ciphertext.
FHE - support all operations instead of just simple operations
RSA => multiplicative homomorphic Encryption

## Control plane
- controls provisioning, auth and permissions
- one control plane for multiple data planes
- Consists of policy-agent and skygraph (directory service)
- policy agent enforcement
