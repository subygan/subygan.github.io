### My website
Super simple website with no complication
we're using notion for writing and typora for its design.
So everything that we write on notion, has to be transferred to typora, compiled to html and then
committed to the directory

## Workflow
The workflow is simple, 
- create a new notebook in notion. keep taking notes there. Notion is especially
incredible for this task.
  
- if notion is with header then use /blog/example/example_with_header_img.html
and fill content from typora 
  
- else, use /blog/example/example.html

- the difference between the two is actually just a css tag.
