    \section*{Overview}

    This homework is ungraded. Rather, it is designed to give you a sense of how comfortable you are with various aspects of probability theory. Probability theory can be a tricky subject, but it is ultimately at the heart of understanding theoretical aspects of privacy. You are not expected to know how to solve all of the following problems, but you should know how to solve at least a few. You should submit at least 5 of the problems on Canvas so that the course staff can get a sense of your familiarity with probability. (For example, problem 1 (a) counts as one problem.) Questions marked with * are trickier, but provide extra insight into the topics being covered.

    \paragraph{Submission instruction.} You are required to type up the homework in LaTeX and submit the pdf on Canvas.
