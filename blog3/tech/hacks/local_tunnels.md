instantly being able to spin up a tunnel with https in my local machine is useful in a lot of cases

### Resources
 - [https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/tunnel-guide/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/tunnel-guide/)

There is a `key.json` file + config.yaml file. where all the routing details are stored.

these are located under `~/.cloudflare/`

_skip caching_

go to page rules
and add a page rule to `cache level: Bypass`

### Downsides

- js is cached making it harder to do js development. (stale: 25Jul2022, use page rules)


### Web socket tunnel
